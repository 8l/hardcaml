Indeed in the same program.\n\nThis offers the designer the ability to cross check between the models at almost completely arbitrary points.\n\nIn contrast many standard design flows use a different language for the reference model (probably C or Perl) and hardware design (Verilog or VHDL).\n\nWhen iterating between models removing the language barrier, and associated trace or debig files, is a big win for HardCaml."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"heading","source":"Generic Hardware","level":2},{"metadata":{},"input":"","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"language":"python","collapsed":false}],"metadata":{}}],"nbformat":3,"nbformat_minor":0}
